Simple Android game engine
==========================

This is a very simple game engine for witing games in Android.
I wrote it when building my game The Jumplings (see my repos). It is not as neat and advanced as other game engines out there as AndEngine, so it might not be very useful to you.

It integrates the 2D physics engine Box2D.
